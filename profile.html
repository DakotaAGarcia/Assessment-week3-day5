		<h1>Hello there, I'm Dakota</h1>
		
		<h2>A little about me:</h2>
			<p>I am a Utah native, born and raised in northern Utah, mainly in the roy area. Out of 5 siblings I am the middle child with 2 younger sisters 2 older sisters and 1 younger brother. I've been married for 3 years. I have been working as a Journeyman plumber for the passed 5 and a half years. That was never something I wanted to do but it is a stable career field as well as high paying. So I stuck with it in order to get my certificate and save up some money to do this course.
                I have always enjoyed computers, problem solving, and math. So I figured computer programming was the route for me. Lets hope i'm not wrong!
            </p>
